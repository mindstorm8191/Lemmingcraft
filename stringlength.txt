Sample LemmingCraft program to determine the length of a string
The string is presumed to be in reverse order on the stack, and ends with a 0 character

Block index (because Lemmingcraft really shows operations with pictures)
Sta = Start, moving right
Is0 = pop the top value, check if top character is zero
Dup = Duplicate the top value
DUn = Pop the top value, then duplicate the value N characters deep
Inc = Increment the top value
Dec = Decrement the top value
Dis = Display the top value
End = End program

                      End
                      Dis
                      Dec
Sta  1  >>  Dup  DUn  Is0
        ^^       Inc   <<

Let's re-order this for a little bit cleaner code

Sta  1  >>  Dup  DUn   vv
        ^^       Inc  Is0  Dec  Dis  End

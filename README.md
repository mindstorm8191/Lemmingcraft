# Lemmingcraft
The aim of this project is to create an animated kind of programming language that is fun to sit and watch it work. Each block on the grid can contain a creature that performs an action on the data it recieves, complete with animations showing it working. It's hard to say how many types of blocks we'll have by the end of this, but hopefully it'll all be fun!

# Lemmingcraft
Its a game, but also a programming language!

The aim of this project is to create an interactive sort of game that can also double as a functional program.  Each block on the
grid can contain a lemming, each of which will perform a different action.  It's hard to say how many types of lemmings we'll have by
the end of this, but hopefully it'll all be fun!

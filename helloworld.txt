Sample program to print Hello World with Lemmingcraft
Block index (because Lemmingcraft really shows operations with pictures)
S = Start (flow moves right from here)
"S" = Push "S" to the stack
P = Display text
E = End proram
------------------

S "0" "D" "L" "R" "O" "W" " " v
E      P  "H" "E" "L" "L" "O" <

------------------
Here's another example! With a new block index:
S = Start (flow moves right)
P = Flag block. Prints pre-defined text when received a non-zero value; in this case "Hello world!"
E = End program

S 1 P E
